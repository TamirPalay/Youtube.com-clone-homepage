When I self-learned html and css using tools online, I decided to put my skills to practice and made a youtube homepage. There is no javascript code attached as of yet but I thought it was a good way to show my proficiency in html and css. Here is the link to open the page in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5500/youtube.html
I did all of the html and css for this project and the design is largely my own. None of the contents on the page are copyrighted.
