When I self-learned html and css using tools online, I decided to put my skills to practice and made a youtube homepage. There is no javascript code attached as of yet but I thought it was a good way to show my proficiency in html and css. Here is the link to open the page in your browser: http://127.0.0.1:5500/youtube.html
I did all of the html and css for this project and the design is largely my own. None of the contents on the page are copyrighted. Although the page doesn't do anything, you can clearly see the time I've put in to the design. Every style, font, color, size and position is coded by me. The page can be resized as well.
